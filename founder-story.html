    <section class="founder-story">
        As a young boy, Mr. Gupta was always into fitness playing various sports and loved being bouncing on his toes.
        At that point, since 1982, his father use to run a famous pharmacy store in the lanes of Sion, Mumbai. Mr. Gupta
        had deep affinity towards medicines, vitamins, minerals, naturals, plants and life sciences since schooling
        days. That’s when he had the first interface to these Nutraceuticals and all he knew was fascination about them,
        how they can help improve one’s life. At the age of 8, looking at the prescriptions flooding at the store,
        seeded the thoughts of pursuing medical doctor in his mind! However, observing the quality of inquisitiveness
        and vigilance that dwelt in him, his father insisted that he should be a police officer, serving the nation or
        become a drug inspector.

        Later in the ‘90s when Mr. Sandeep Gupta launched Omega 3 supplement in the Indian market for the first time, is
        when he got into studying these Nutraceuticals in detail and since then he has been hooked onto these miraculous
        ingredients.

        Earlier the Nutraceutical industry in India did not have any set structure. There were multiple bodies,
        associations, task forces in place which functioned in silos and there was no synergy in their objectives which
        led to under development of the sector. Each of the bodies had a very different approach with vested interests,
        no clarity or guidance. This led to a division in the Health sector which was a major disadvantage. While
        appealing to the government for representing any issues, there was no unity within the stakeholders.

        There was an immense need of an unidirectional approach for truly evolving
        the sector. It was a mammoth task to create equivalence and bring everyone together, understand the issues and
        then present it as one for the resolution in the interest of Public Health. Understanding the gap in the
        industry Mr. Gupta met various ministries to get a resolution in that situation but to no avail. So, he focused
        on creating a movement & fight for the betterment of the society. He always believed that the principle to
        succeed is all about the TEAM (Together Everyone Achieves More), ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’.

        Back in the decade Nutraceutical was a much unorganized sector in terms of its rules & regulations. Emergence of
        FSSAct was due to a prevailing outdated PFA Act, 1954 which was risking people’s life. The entire food industry
        was covered under this Act without having proper regulations in place for different categories of Foods.
        Everything & anything under the roof of PFA Act 1954 was imported, manufactured, marketed, and distributed in
        India which was assessed for its safety and was also not standardised for its profiling.

        Though Food Business Operators were using Codex and International
        Reference Standards to use them in Food Products in India, which was not pre-measured by the
        authorities. The Premise of FSSAI was to assess the safety & standards and define regulations for various food
        articles and categorise them systematically for which the regulations were missing.

        Hence the essentiality of Act was getting lost in vain and thereby the entire process was disrupted with random
        Product Approval Process. This Product Approval Process did not form any legal premise under FSSAct of Section
        22 which demanded to design the regulations for supervision, monitoring and regulating the food safety and
        standards.

        To bring regulations, industry made umpteen number of attempts with detailed explanatory note to authorities and
        various ministries through several representations during the chaos of Product Approval system which remained an
        unveiled process
        and thereby which, industry moved to court to appeal for directing authorities to draft regulation.


        Under the Direction of Standing Parliament Committee, Ministry Of Health various Standard Review Groups (SRG)
        were formed by FSSAI. Mr. Gupta was elected unanimously as Authority to chair the SRG, Nutraceuticals by the
        choice of the industry.

        Mr. Sandeep Gupta joined hands with Mr. Ganesh Kamath, Director, Vital Neutraceuticals, and
        Dr. R. K. Sanghavi, Consulting Physician & Heatlhcare Expert. For more than two and a half decade these three
        musketeers are knitted and are regarded as the pioneering ‘Founder of Nutraceuticals in India’.

        For larger purpose, they came together with the vision to create a well-defined structure
        and provide a guideline for the industry for smooth functioning in the future. Expert Nutraceutical Advocacy
        Council (ENAC®) was born then in 2015 in the interest of Public Health.

        These three musketeers pioneered in forefront to draft and reinforce the Nutraceutical Regulation, with the
        support of more than 150 top experts of the country, which was gazetted and released in 2016. This channelized
        the industry’s approach giving an opportunity to launch various nutraceuticals in India adopted from Global
        markets blended with potential resources from the home country. Since then the nutraceutical sector has been
        exponentially growing and will always be on edge improving for better life.

        In the wake of overcoming numerous challenges and witnessing the normalization of the nutraceutical industry,
        Sandeep Gupta embarked on a transformative journey by founding Nutraworks. This visionary venture extends its
        influence beyond the boundaries of the nutraceutical sector, branching into the realms of pharmaceuticals,
        cosmetics, and Ayurvedic formulations. Catering to both the vibrant Indian market and the dynamic international
        arena, Nutraworks stands as a comprehensive service provider, offering an array of invaluable services.

        range of services positions Nutraworks as a versatile and indispensable partner for businesses across various
        industries, ensuring not only compliance but also strategic growth and innovation.

        Sandeep Gupta's journey, marked by resilience and foresight, has culminated in the establishment of Nutraworks—a
        testament to his commitment to excellence, adaptability to changing landscapes, and dedication to shaping the
        future of the health and wellness industry. As Nutraworks continues to thrive, it exemplifies the spirit of
