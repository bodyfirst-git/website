                            <p>I cant agree more than what our dear Prof. Shrikar Kulkarni has to say about Sandeep.
                                Infact way back in 1996-97, we could see an emerging and scintillating entrepreneur in
                                him when we both closely managed our most beloved project "Enoch Pharmaceuticals" and we
                                went thru' both good and difficult times together which was full of rich experience
                                which has shown us different shades of learning through practical concepts and approach.
                                Also we as a team (entire class of '97) together have created a need for the
                                Pharmaceutical Management Specialist in the Industry which has given birth to various
                                other Pharmaceutical Management Colleges in the Country. Infact Sandeep and the likes
                                from our batch have played a pivotal role in escalating the image of IES as a management
                                institute. From deep down in the heart come my best wishes and may you ascend heights
                                that no person has achieved so far in the Pharma industry."

                            <p>Sandeep is creativity personified! To add to this, his skills in strategizing and
                                implementing the tasks are exemplary. His multi-task management helps him stand out of
                                the crowd. All the tasks assigned to him were always brought to fruition within
                                deadlines. He is a good team player and trustworthy colleague who is always ready to go
                                out of the way and help the team. His creative campaigns for Baycip, Bayer’s tonic and

                            <p>One of the most energetic person I have ever come across with a unique combination of
                                strategic and creative skills. However, unlike the most, Sandeep knows how to translate
                                the idea into action and keep the entire team focused on the task. A great team leader
                                who knows strengths and weakness of each team member and gets the best out of each with
                                motivations kicking in all time. Got to work on some of the most interesting and
                                different activities with Sandeep. One person with such skills in any organization will
                                make work of other people difficult as the standards set are truly high and senior mgmt
                                is sure to expects the same from others.
